# Learn-IT-Girl-Project
Computational biology project in Learn IT, Girl program

This project involves computational biology concepts using python programming. The aim(s) of this project are:

1. Get nucleotide sequences of a particular gene from at least 10 different organisms
2. Perform multiple sequence alignment of these gene sequences obtained from different organisms
3. Construct a distance matrix based on the genetic distance between the gene sequences
4. Construct a phylogenetic tree based on the distance matrix

Expected outcomes of the project:
The mentee acquires :
1. Basic knowledge on biological databases like NCBI and tools such as ClustalW
2. Knowledge of key concepts in computational biology like MSA, distance matrices and various types of phylogenetic trees
3. Ability to encounter biological problems through coding
4. Knowledge of key concepts in biology such as molecular evolution
